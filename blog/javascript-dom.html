      <h3>What is JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS?</h3>
      <div class="blog5img">
        <p>
          Imagine a website is like an aeroplane. HTML is the structure of the
          plane, where the wings are, where the cockpit is. CSS is the design of
          the plane, what colour it is and the patterns on the seats. Javascript
          is the engine and all the mechanics of the plane that you don't see
          but are crucial to making the plane fly. Controlling the wings
          rudders, maintaining altitude and deploying the landing gear.
          Javascript working behind the scenes is like magic, but coding it is
          the opposite. Javascript adds interactivity to your webpage and allows
          for elements to change without having to refresh the page. HTML CSS
          and JavaScript all need to work together to create an advanced modern
          webpage. </br></br>Here is an example of how JavaScript can manipulate the webpage:</br></br><a id="aeroplaneLink">Click this link to make the plane fly</a>
        </p>
        <script src="blog-5-script.js"></script>
        <img src="/images/how-do-planes-fly.jpg" id="aeroplane" />
        
      </div>
      <h3>Control flow and loops</h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript by default will run from top to bottom, running through the
        code line by line. Control Flow lets the program make decisions when to
        execute the code. It does this with conditional statements and loops.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Conditional statements</strong></p>
      <p>
        Conditional statements are checks to see wether a condition is true or
        false. Below is an example to see wether you need to take an umbrella
        with you.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>  if (its raining outside) { 

                grab umbrella
                leave

              } else if (if it looks like it might rain){

                grab umbrella
                leave

              } else {

                put on a hat
                leave

              }
        </code>
        </pre>
      <p><strong>Loops</strong></p>
      <p>
        Loops let you repeat an action a fixed number of times or until a
        condition is met. A for loop is set with a counter <code> let i = 0</code> and the
        condition is how many times to loop through <code> i &lt; 10</code> then the count
        is updated <code>i++</code>.
      </p>
      <pre>
      <code>for (let i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) { 

              loop through 10 times

            } 
      </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        You have to be careful to give a condition that will end or you may
        create an infinite loop that could crash your computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Do not do the below loop. As eating snacks will never make boredom
          false you will end up snacking infinitely.</strong
        >
      </p>

      <pre>
          <code>while (boredom is true) { 
    
                  eat snacks
    
                } 
          </code>
          </pre>
      <div class="blog5img">

          <h3>What is the DOM?</h3>
          <p>
            The DOM, or Document Object Model is a representation of the webpage
            that lets JavaScript interact with the style, structure and content
            of the page. It is a tree like structure made up of the elements of
            the HTML document, with other elements and attributes nested in.
            (See image for a visual representation.) These elements can be
            modified, added and removed using JavaScript. The DOM also has the
            ability to react to user events like clicks ot key presses, making
            your website more interactive and responsive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below are some examples of how JavaScript uses the DOM to interact
            with the HTML elements:
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>document.querySelectorAll("p")</code> will access all the
            <code>p</code>
            elements
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>document.getElementById("this")</code> will access the element
            with <code>id="this"</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>document.getElementByClassName("that")</code> will access all
            the elements with <code>class="that"</code>
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <img src="/images/dom.webp" class="memeImg" />
        </section>
      </div>
      <h3>Accessing data from arrays and objects</h3>
      <p><strong>Arrays</strong></p>
      <p>
        Arrays are a list of values in one variable. These values can be
        accessed by referring to their index numbers. It is important to note,
        arrays start counting at 0.
      </p>
      <pre>
                           0        1        2
        <code>const drinks = ["coke", "sprite", "fanta"];
          let myDrink = drinks[0];</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        myDrink selects the first item in the array (0), so my drink will be a
        coke. If it was <code>drinks[2]</code> my drink would be a fanta.
      </p>
      </br>
      <p><strong>Objects</strong></p>
      <p>Objects are variables that hold key and value pairs. Below is an example object of a dog:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>const dog1 = {
            name: "Chump", 
            breed: "Pug", 
            cuteness: 10,
          }</code>
      </pre>
      <p>The keys are the name, breed and cuteness, with the values detailed beside them. Objects properties can be accessed by objectName.keyName or objectName["keyName"]</p>
      <p><code>dog1.name</code> will give you a string of "Chump"<code>dog1.cuteness</code> will give you the number 10</p>
      <br />

      <h3>What are functions? Why are they helpful</h3>
      <p>A function is a block of code that does a particular task. Functions will only run if they are called to. Functions are made by using the keyword <code>function</code>, then the name followed by brackets. They can also take in parameters inside the brackets.</p>
      <pre>
        <code>function exampleFunction() {
          execute this code
        }
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>This will only run if it is called by <code>exampleFunction()</code> outright or inside of another function.</p>
      <p>Functions are very helpful as they save writing out the same code over and over again. If you need to execute the same lines of codes multiple times, create a function and call to it with just the name and brackets whenever it is needed.</p>
