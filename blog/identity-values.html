      <h3>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h3>
      <p>
        At my previous job I was kept on as a essential worker during the
        initial covid isolation. I had customers who were also essential that we
        needed to supply goods to keep them up and running. One customer asked
        me for a product and when I went to get it I was asked how imperative
        this was as it would involve bringing someone out of their isolation to
        supply. I had a big ethical dilemma as I wasn't comfortable bringing
        someone out of isolation, exposing them and their family to risk. I
        talked with my manager at the time to discuss this dilemma and we came
        to a solution that didn't involve bringing anyone out of isolation.
        Looking back now I think I definitely made the right call as the
        solution worked out for everyone.

      <h3>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I went to Aquinas college which is a catholic college in Tauranga.
        Although I no longer practice religion, I believe they taught good
        values. The golden rule being; treat others as you wish to be treated.
        They also put a very high emphasis on education. While at Aquinas I made
        lifelong friendships with the people I went there with, we still hang
        out to this day. I also have a very loving a supportive family around me
        which I am very grateful for, especially now I am taking part in this
        course while living with my parents.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I believe some of my strengths are that I am a fast learner, I have a
        logical mind and I am cool headed under stress. These strengths will all
        be valuable in this course but I may need to be careful I don't get
        bogged down trying to figure everything out myself instead of reaching
        out for help.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I will need to stay motivated and accountable for my time studying as I
        can be easily distracted and go off on a tangent. I tend to get really
        into a topic and learn all I can quickly then drop it once it starts to
        get difficult. I also believe taking regular breaks is important as I
        can get caught up in a problem and spend too long on it which will
        eventually lead to burnout. During the first sprint I found that going
        to the gym helped me relax and even solve some problems I couldn't sort
        at the computer.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h3>
      <p>
        At my previous job I was tasked with training some new employees. We had
        a few employees that had difficulties picking up the job we tried many
        different strategies to help, including checking over anything they
        needed, quizzing them on basics and regular meetings to see how they
        were feeling. I think the strategies used were good, however they didn't
        end up being effective as both employees ended up having to be let go.
        In future I would implement the same strategies and continue to show
        empathy. Looking back it was a difficult job and not everyone is cut out
        for it.
