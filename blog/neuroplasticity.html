      <h3>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset and how it influences learning</h3>
      <h3>14 April 2025</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-block">
      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to form and reorganize
        neural connections, the idea that our brains are malleable and moldable,
        just like plastic. We used to think that our brains were fixed,
        especially in adulthood, but we now know that our brains are flexible.
      </p>
      <h3>
        How can understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit you?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Just knowing your brain can adapt change and grow will help remove
        barriers to learning. Many people think I'm not smart enough, or my
        brain doesn't work a certain way. But if you know that the brain can
        adapt and change through training and reflecting, you won't put these
        barriers on yourself and your learning possibilities will be endless.
      </p>

      </p>
      <h3>How can I use the principles of neuroplasticity for my benefit?</h3>
      <p>
        I have already made a commitment to improve my physical fitness earlier
        this year and knowing how this can improve my learning capabilities
        further proves its importance. I will make sure when I am learning that
        I will minimize distractions to improve my focus. I will space out the
        learning over time and not rush ahead to avoid burning out. I will also
        commit to practicing every day to move new concepts from short term to
        long term memory.
      </p>
      <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
      <p>
        There are many things you can do to help implement neuroplasticity in
        your everyday life. Including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Physical activity (walking, sports, gym)</li>
        <li>Playing games (video games, board games, etc.)</li>
        <li>Learning something new (languages, instruments, skills)</li>
        <li>Practicing mindfulness through meditation</li>
        <li>Making sure you are in a good learning environment</li>
        <li>Getting enough sleep</li>
        <li>Repetition and practice</li>
        <li>Reflection</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
      <h3>What is a growth mindset and why is it relevant?</h3>
      <p>
        A growth mindset is the belief that intelligence and skills are not
        inherited but come from learning, hard work and repitition. It promotes
        taking on challenges, repitition and practice and viewing failure as an
        opportunity to learn. This is very relevant to the Dev Academy course as
        no one is born knowing how to code, we all have to learn, embrace the
        challenge and not let failure bring us down if we want to be successful.
      </p>
      <h3>Something that surprised me</h3>
      <p>
        When first presented with this concept, I thought to myself that I do
        have a growth mindset. In the last sprint I embraced the challenges of
        the JavaScript Cafe stretches, and enjoyed figuring out the puzzles.
        However when I thought deeper I realised I don't think this way in all
        aspects of life. I have always thought I don't have a creative mind, and
        would always take the back seat in my band when it came to writing
        music. I just thought "My brain doesn't work that way so I won't try."
        Now that I have researched neuroplasticity and growth mindset, I want to
        start being more creative and maybe it won't be the best to start off,
        but with a bit of hard work and repitition I can increase my abilities
        and create something to be proud of.
      </p>
      <h3>How will I integrate growth mindset into my learning journey?</h3>
      <p>
        I will commit to putting in the work, practicing every day and
        reflecting on what I have learnt and where I found difficulty. I will
        not see failure as my downfall, but use it as an opportunity to learn
        and grow. I will also ask for help when I need it, and not see this as a
        negative, but as another opportunity for growth. I will implement this
        not only for this course but for all aspects in my life including in
        music and at the gym.
