      <h3>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</h3>

      <h3>Display: Block vs. Inline vs. Inline-Block</h3>
      <p>Display is the property that specifies how an element is displayed.</p>
      <p>
        All elements have a default display property. But these can be
        manipulated in CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Block</strong> elements take up the maximum space, or the whole
        line, and have a width and height, eg. h1, p, div.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Inline</strong> elements take up the minimum space possible, and
        appear on the same line, but do not have a width and height, eg. a,
        span.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Inline-block</strong> elements also take up the minimum space
        possible, but have a width and height, eg. img
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>

      <p>I have set up a simple page to show how these displays work:</p>
      <div class="blog1-img">
        HTML
        <img src="/images/snips/Capture.PNG" class="blog1-img-small" />
        CSS
        <img src="/images/snips/Capture14.PNG" class="blog1-img-small" />
        Output
        <img src="/images/snips/Capture2.PNG" class="blog1-img-small" />
      </div>
      <p>As you can see there are two div and two span elements.</p>
      <p>
        The div elements (block) take up a whole line each and the span's
        (inline) take up the minimum space and appear on the same line.
      </p>
      <div class="blog1-img">
        <img src="/images/snips/Capture3.PNG" class="blog1-img-small" />
        <img src="/images/snips/Capture4.PNG" class="blog1-img-small" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Now I have added a height of 100px to each. The block elements have
        increased in height, but the inline ones have not changed.
      </p>
      <div class="blog1-img">
        <img src="/images/snips/Capture5.PNG" class="blog1-img-small" />
        <img src="/images/snips/Capture6.PNG" class="blog1-img-small" />
      </div>
      <p>
        I have now added an img element (inline-block) between the two div's.
        Since the div's are block elements the img is on it's own line.
      </p>
      <div class="blog1-img">
        <img src="/images/snips/Capture7.PNG" class="blog1-img-small" />
        <img src="/images/snips/Capture8.PNG" class="blog1-img-small" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Now I have put the img between the two span elements. You can see that
        it acts like an inline element, taking up the minimum space and
        appearing on the same line.
      </p>
      <div class="blog1-img">
        <img src="/images/snips/Capture9.PNG" class="blog1-img-small" />
        <img src="/images/snips/Capture10.PNG" class="blog1-img-small" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Now the img is between the div and span elements. I have changed the
        display of the elements in CSS, without changing their HTML. (Please
        note the text in the image above is no longer correct.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The blue blocks have been changed to display: inline; They share the
        same line but no longer have a height of 100px.
      </p>
      <p>
        The img is now set to display: block; It takes up a whole line and does
        not appear by the inline elements above.
      </p>
      <p>
        The red blocks have been set to display: inline-block; They appear on
        the same line but now can take on the height of 100px.
      </p>
      <div class="blog1-img">
        <img src="/images/snips/Capture11.PNG" class="blog1-img-small" />
        <img src="/images/snips/Capture12.PNG" class="blog1-img-small" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Lastly, I have set the img to display: none; This makes the image
        disappear and the other elements act as if it's not there.
      </p>
