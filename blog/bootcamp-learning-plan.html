      <h2>Blog 10: Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>
      <h3>My updated learning plan regarding Bootcamp.</h3>
      <h3>25 April 2025</h3>

      <h2>Bootcamp Update:</h2>
      <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        My professional goal is to get a job as a web developer, where I could
        hopefully work remote and continue to travel. Alternatively I would like
        to get a job overseas to continue where I left off. My personal goal is
        to make games using the skills I have learnt in Dev Academy, but will
        most likely be in another language, using Unity or Unreal Engine.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think a strength of mine is that I can remain cool, calm and collected
        under stress. I think this will be helpful during group work and I can
        act as a rock for my teammates when the going gets tough. I know one of
        my limitations will be making code that is readable and easily
        understood by others as so far I have just been writing code that only I
        work on, and sometimes I don't understand it. Working on clear naming
        and structuring will be important moving forward.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Keeping to a good schedule will be a challenge I definitely need to stay
        on top of throughout bootcamp. I was really good the first 3 weeks,
        going to bed at a reasonable time and studying from 9-5 every day. I did
        let this slip at the end of week 4, staying up late working on my
        personal projects and getting carried away debugging. Although this was
        not too bad seeing as foundations is self directed, I really can't
        afford to do this during bootcamp as I will need to be up and working in
        the morning and being tired could let my teammates down.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I would like to improve my communications skills and overall confidence.
        I will need these skills for working in teams and avoiding any
        unnecessary conflict due to miscommunication. I will need to get better
        at receiving feedback, not that I react negatively, just that I avoid
        seeking feedback for fear of it being negative.
      </p>
      <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
      <p>
        I expect them to be helpful and kind. I expect them to give feedback,
        negative or positive, but in a constructive manner.
      </p>
      <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
      <p>
        I will avoid distractions and minimize unrelated projects unless I have
        ample time. My time is fully committed to this course and is my sole
        focus for the 9 weeks. I will get adequate rest and take necessary
        breaks so that I am always refreshed and in my best frame of mind.

      <h2>Foundations Learning Plan:</h2>
      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        I want to get a career in the tech industry that I can be proud of. One
        that is both challenging and has opportunity for growth. Being able to
        work remote would also be a bonus so I could work while traveling.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p>
        I believe some of my strengths are that I am a fast learner, I have a
        logical mind and I am cool headed under stress. These strengths will all
        be valuable in this course but may also be my limitation, as I usually
        like to figure everything out on my own instead of reaching out for
        help.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I would like to continue to develop my confidence in general, and in my
        abilities. My communication in person and online as I am usually quite
        reserved and don't really use social media. I would also like to improve
        my organisation and time management skills as this is an area I could
        definitely improve on.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include:
      </h3>
      <h3>
        An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and
        safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
        representatives
      </h3>
      <p>
        I am pretty easy going and can get along with anyone so I have no
        worries about working with others. I am quite looking forward to it as
        everyone in the academy seems really friendly.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
      </h3>
      <p>
        I will take a step away from the computer, walk outside for a bit, or
        most likely hit the gym (if I need a long break). I have found in the
        first sprint this really helped to clear my head and I even figured out
        a way to solve the issue I was having. And if I find this doesn't help,
        I will reach out to my facilitator to let them know I am struggling.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h3>
      <p>
        I will first try to solve the issue myself, then try google, then reach
        out to the discord for assistance. I will use the time blocks and Toggl
        as a guide to how I am progressing. If I have gone over time I will
        reach out right away.
      </p>
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p>
        I expect the facilitators to be friendly and helpful, and give
        constructive feedback when necessary.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Nothing to commit, working tree clean. I am fully committed to this
        course and have no other real obligations. I will go to the gym daily
        during lunch break but this is flexible if I am busy or something comes
        up.
