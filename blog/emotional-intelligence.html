      <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence? EQ vs. IQ</h3>

      <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence, or EQ, is the awareness of your feelings and how
        they affect you and the people around you. Also your awareness of other
        peoples feelings and how to respond appropriately. Emotional
        Intelligence can help with creating and building relationships and being
        more flexible and adjusting to changes.
      </p>
      <p>Working on your emotional intelligence can help with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Self-Awareness</li>
        <li>Self-Regulation</li>
        <li>Motivation</li>
        <li>Empathy</li>
        <li>Social skills</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3>How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
      <p>
        IQ refers to intellectual intelligence, how you use logic to solve
        problems and how you learn and understand new ideas.
      </p>
      <p>If you have a high IQ you might excel with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Logical thinking</li>
        <li>Problem solving</li>
        <li>Planning and strategizing</li>
        <li>Understanding new or different ideas</li>
        <li>Being adaptable</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        EQ and IQ are very different but both are important for developing a
        successful career. Some research shows that EQ plays a bigger part than
        IQ in how successful you will be. If you have a very high IQ, but a low
        EQ, you may not find as much success as someone that has a lower IQ, but
        higher EQ.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
      <p>
        EQ is important because it helps you understand your emotions and how to
        manage them. It helps to empathize with others and socialize more
        effectively. This will in turn lead to better communication, building
        better relationships and finding success in life, inside and outside
        your career.
