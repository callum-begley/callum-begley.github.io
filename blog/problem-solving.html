      <h3>A time I was blocked on a simple problem</h3>
      <p>
        Very early on in the Kata challenges, I was stumped by a simple task.
        The challenge was to:
        <code
          >"Add a spouse key to the adam object and assign it the value of
          terah."</code
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        I quickly added a new line: <code>adam.spouse = 'terah'</code> and
        thought to myself that was easy. Only to save the JavaScript file and
        see the test had not passed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This then lead to a series of brute force trial and error attempts to
        try and solve it. When that still didn't fix it, I went to my old pal
        Google. From what I could see I had the right idea the first time, so
        why wasn't it working?
      </p>
      <p>
        I tried my original idea again, just to be sure. Then I tried using
        Terah with a capital T. Still nothing was working so I decided to have a
        small break.
      </p>
      <p>
        After returning to my PC, I decided to delete what I had and start from
        scratch. I then proceeded to slowly and thoroughly read the question out
        loud.
      </p>
      <p>
        I realised I had just skim read it the first time. It was not asking for
        a string to be added but a value. So I tried again
        <code>adam.spouse = terah</code> and lo and behold the test passed.
      </p>
      <p>
        You would think I would have learnt my lesson from this, but I faced
        this same issue in later challenges.
      </p>
      <p><strong>TLDR; Read the question properly!</strong></p>

      <h3>A time I elegantly solved a problem</h3>
      <p>
        During the JavaScript Olympics I faced the challenge: 
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>3.1 Create a function called removeOdds that accepts an array of 
          numbers. Return an array with only the even numbers.

      </p>
      <p>
        You can do this manually or use built-in JavaScript Array Methods.</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        I knew I could do this manually with a for loop and using the filter 
        method from a previous challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I started by writing pseudocode for both options. I decided to do the for 
        loop first as it was something I was more comfortable with. And using my 
        pseudocode I was quickly able to make the test go green.
      </p>
      <p>
        I commented this solution out and decided to try the filter method as my second 
        attempt. I went back to the previous challenge where I used a filter and copied 
        and pasted it into the current challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        With just a few tweaks I was able to make the test go green again. This felt 
        great as I had learnt a new way to do the task and although I wasn't as 
        comfortable it actually turned out to be a much simpler solution. And now in 
        future I have a new and superior solution up my sleeve that I am a bit more confident using.

      <h3>
        How confident I feel using each of these problem-solving
        techniques/processes

      <ul >
        <li class="listSpacer">
          Pseudocode - 7 - I am confident but usually have to veer off the plan
          when it doesn't work
        </li>
        <li class="listSpacer">
          Trying something - 9 - This is definitely my first go to but isn't
          always the best idea for new concepts
        </li>

          Rubber ducky method - 0 - I have not used this technique yet so I will
          need to find myself a duck
        </li>
        <li class="listSpacer">
          Reading error messages - I found this very helpful and it often
          alerted me to quickly solve the error
        </li>
        <li class="listSpacer">
          Console.logging - 10 - I used this often to check what my elements
          were doing at any stage
        </li>

          Googling - 10 - Probably the most helpful tool for finding a solution

          not yet

        <li class="listSpacer">
          Asking coaches for help - 7 - I had to reach out once as I couldn't
          figure out the issue and it was quickly solved by changing let to
          const
        </li>

          Improving your process with reflection - 5 - This is something I could

      <h3>A time I was reluctant to ask for help</h3>
      <p>I am quite often reluctant to ask for help as I want to figure things out on my own. 
        During the last sprint I couldn't find a solution to the problem I was facing. I had 
        used google and was testing my code on a site and it looked like the logic was correct.
        The challenge was to make a function that counts how many names in an array had less 
        than 5 characters. My function looked like this:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
        function countShortNames(h) {
          let x = 0
          for (variable of h) {
            if (variable.length &lt; 5) {
              x++
            }
          }
          console.log(x)
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>After my timebox suggested time was up I reluctantly reached out to my facilitator David. 
      He promptly replied with the solution:</p>
      
      <p>
      "for a for...of loop in js 
      we need to declare the variable with <code>const</code> to create it properly within the loop. 
      Try putting that before <code>variable</code> in the parentheses"</p>
      <p>
        So I had the solution in minutes after trying to solve myself for over an hour. I will make 
        my best effort to reach out in future as it is very helpful and thats what the facilitators 
        are there for, although I will keep trying to solve it myself first, I now am a little less reluctant 
        to reach out.
      </p>
      <p><strong>TLDR; Don't be afraid to reach out!</strong></p>
