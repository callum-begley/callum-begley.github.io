      <h2>Blog 9: Foundations Reflection</h2>
      <h3>Looking back over the last few weeks.</h3>

      <h3>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the Human Skills learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I can do anything if I set my mind to it, I have been putting barriers
        on myself and that if I want to be a good programmer I will need to work
        well with other people.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Values are important because they set the standard that you hold
        yourself to. Empathy is also important so you are aware of how others
        feel, and how the things you say and do effect them. This also ties in
        to self awareness.
      </p>
      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h3>
      <p>
        I have always thought my brain works a certain way and theres nothing I
        can do about it. But when learning about neuroplasticity, I realised I
        was just putting limitations on myself. I have always thought I was not
        creative even though I am into music, I would always put a barrier on
        myself and not even try creating music of my own.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I don't usually write about myself and how I'm feeling so this was hard
        for me. I think that I am getting better at it with each reflection and
        new blog.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Because programming is only half of it. Employers are looking for a well
        rounded individual who would be an asset to their team. They don't want
        to hire someone that is great at coding, but can't work in their team.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
        waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice
        programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </h3>
      <p>
        No it isn't a waste of time. I will admit at the beginning I was a bit
        skeptical, but I do understand how important it is for career and self
        growth. If this course was just about coding, it wouldn't truly set us
        up for a successful coding career.
