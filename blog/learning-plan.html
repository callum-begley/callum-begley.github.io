      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        I want to get a career in the tech industry that I can be proud of. One
        that is both challenging and has opportunity for growth. Being able to
        work remote would also be a bonus so I could work while traveling.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p>
        I believe some of my strengths are that I am a fast learner, I have a
        logical mind and I am cool headed under stress. These strengths will all
        be valuable in this course but may also be my limitation, as I usually
        like to figure everything out on my own instead of reaching out for
        help.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I would like to continue to develop my confidence in general, and in my
        abilities. My communication in person and online as I am usually quite
        reserved and don't really use social media. I would also like to improve
        my organisation and time management skills as this is an area I could
        definitely improve on.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include:
      </h3>
      <h3>
        An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and
        safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
        representatives
      </h3>
      <p>
        I am pretty easy going and can get along with anyone so I have no
        worries about working with others. I am quite looking forward to it as
        everyone in the academy seems really friendly.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
      </h3>
      <p>
        I will take a step away from the computer, walk outside for a bit, or
        most likely hit the gym (if I need a long break). I have found in the
        first sprint this really helped to clear my head and I even figured out
        a way to solve the issue I was having. And if I find this doesn't help,
        I will reach out to my facilitator to let them know I am struggling.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h3>
      <p>
        I will first try to solve the issue myself, then try google, then reach
        out to the discord for assistance. I will use the time blocks and Toggl
        as a guide to how I am progressing. If I have gone over time I will
        reach out right away.
      </p>
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p>
        I expect the facilitators to be friendly and helpful, and give
        constructive feedback when necessary.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Nothing to commit, working tree clean. I am fully committed to this
        course and have no other real obligations. I will go to the gym daily
        during lunch break but this is flexible if I am busy or something comes
        up.
