      <p>Hi, my name is Callum.</p>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in Tauranga. I am currently living in Papamoa
        beach, just down the road from the mount. I love living by the beach and
        these beautiful mountains. I try to climb one once a week.
      </p>
      <p>
        My hobbies include travelling, playing and creating music, PC gaming and
        working out at the gym.

      <h3>Travel</h3>
      <p>
        In 2024 I quit my job and sold all my belongings to travel the world. I
        started off arriving in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam. This was a huge culture
        shock coming from a small NZ city, to a city with almost double the
        population of the entire country.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no road rules, or crossing signals, you just have to walk
        confidently out into the street and the sea of scooters will flow around
        you. One great thing about Vietnam is the food, I had a Banh Mi every
        morning from a street vendor. And nothing beats a cold beer on a 40+
        degree day.
      </p>
      <p>
        After spending a month in Vietnam, I traveled around Thailand for a
        month before heading to Europe to backpack around.

      <h3>Europe</h3>
      <p>Here are some photos from my travels around Europe</p>
      <p>
        I stayed for a week on the Greek island Naxos and ate gyros every day
        for only 3 euros.
      </p>
      <p>Switzerland's scenery was stunning.</p>
      <p>I loved the architecture and history in all the European cities.</p>

      <h3>Pet Sitting</h3>
      <p>
        I was very lucky to discover an app called Trusted House Sitters. You
        stay at someones house for free while you look after their pets.
      </p>
      <p>
        This allowed me to extend my travels and also visit Switzerland which I
        was going to miss as it is quite expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
        I ended up looking after 13 dogs and 2 cats. Here are some photos of a
        few of my favourites.
      </p>

        Malcolm and Bailie, two brothers I ended up sitting for a few times as
        they were just outside Edinburgh. Chump the Scottish Pug, Lexi the one
        eyed Frenchie in Switzerland and Molly the Labradoodle with a very long
        snoot.

      <h3>Edinburgh</h3>
      <p>I finally ended up in Edinburgh, Scotland to live.</p>
      <p>
        I was fortunate enough to get one really snowy day, my first ever apart
        from Mt Ruapehu. but unfortunately I missed the fringe festival, so I
        will need to head back sometime soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately (or not,) I was unable to find a good job which lead me
        back home and to Dev Academy
      </p>
      <p>
        Traveling is great and I would recommend it to everyone, but it does
        make you realize how good we have it here in New Zealand.

      <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>
        One of my favorite hobbies is music. I started learning guitar at 14 and
        have loved it ever since. I also taught myself to play piano, bass, and
        drums. Lately, I like to record covers on my home setup but as I sold my
        guitars before traveling I only have one acoustic to play on. Previously
        I have been in a few bands, mostly playing rock and metal covers with a
        few originals.
      </p>

        Check out this song I recorded of my band in my garage.
